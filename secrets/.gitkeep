# Secrets Directory

This directory stores sensitive files that should NOT be committed to Git.

## Required Files (Production)

Place the following file in this directory before running Docker Compose:

```
secrets/
└── firebase-service-account.json
```

## How to Obtain Firebase Service Account Key

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project → Project Settings → Service Accounts
3. Click "Generate New Private Key"
4. Download the JSON file
5. Rename it to `firebase-service-account.json`
6. Place it in this `secrets/` directory

## Security

- NEVER commit `firebase-service-account.json` to Git
- Set file permissions: `chmod 600 secrets/firebase-service-account.json`
- This directory is ignored by `.gitignore` (except this `.gitkeep` file)

## Local Development

For local development, you can also place the Firebase key in:
- `src/main/resources/firebase-service-account.json`
